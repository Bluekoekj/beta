## Information!

You are about to see what this website looked like before I started using GitHub pages.

Do you wish to proceed?

### Please note:

This part of the website may look like rubbish because I used Comic Sans MS. I tried the beta site with my Samsung Galaxy A32 and it came out as a different font. 
Just wanted to make you aware of that!
